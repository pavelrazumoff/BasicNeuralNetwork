# Basic Neural Network
This simple neural network was created for learning purposes. Main network class code was created by [makeyourownneuralnetwork](https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork). My version is a little improvement of this code and provides some options to manage this network. Its main purpose is to recognize numbers in images.

## What options do you get
1. You can train network with MNIST dataset, that you can get from [here](https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/).

2. When training was completed, you can save it and load later.

3. With trained network you are able to test it with my image dataset or create your own (28x28 PNG image is necessary).

4. Also you can uncomment some code lines and use MNIST test dataset with more data instead of the images. This dataset allows you to check for efficiency of your network.

5. Finally, you can look at how network sees numbers after it was trained by passing digits to it.

## How to run it
The code was running with **Python 3.7.3**. Here are some packages, that you will need:

1. **NumPy**

2. **Matplotlib**

3. **SciPy**

4. **Imageio**
